When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on a computer that is not yours.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe you don't want certain files on your local.

fork is a separate path of work started from a separate repository.
clones is a copy of a cloud-based repo.
branch is a separate path of work w/in a single repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Access in case you don't have internet connection or in case github is down.
