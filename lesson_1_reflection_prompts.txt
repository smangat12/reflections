What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Having only manual commits could result in forgetting to commit and losing your work.
    That is a con.
    A pro would be that you have more control over your commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is more focused on programming and in programming,
    there is much file inter-dependency.
    Google docs is primarily a word processor and there is little file
    inter-dependency.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will show you all the commits ever done for a particular repo.
    git diff will show you the difference between commits.
    By using both commands, you can get a full understand of file histories.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If I break something, w/version control I can always go back to a commit when everything was working.
